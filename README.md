## About Me

With over **5+ years** of deep experience, I build and scale SaaS & AI-driven products that delight users and solve real problems. I specialize in end-to-end ownership — from architecture and development to launch, QA, and iteration. I’ve partnered (contractually) with organizations like **MTM** and **NASA**, taking technical visions to production reality.

My sweet spot lies at the intersection of **modern JavaScript frameworks** (Next.js, NestJS, etc.), **backend & API systems** (Node.js, Supabase, databases), and **AI/ML & generative systems** (OpenAI / LLM integrations). I lead teams, unblock bottlenecks, and ensure launches succeed.

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend / UI**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI  
- **Backend / APIs / Microservices**: Node.js, NestJS, Express, REST & GraphQL  
- **Databases / Storage / Infra**: Supabase, PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, Vercel  
- **Payments / Billing**: Stripe, webhooks, subscription systems  
- **AI / LLM / Prompting**: OpenAI API, prompt engineering, custom logic layers  
- **DevOps / CI-CD / Monitoring**: GitHub Actions, Vercel, log/metrics tooling  
- **Collab / Product Ops**: Notion, Slack, Jira, Trello, Figma (for UI), stakeholder alignment

## Featured Projects & Repos

Below are some of the standout repositories you’ll find in my profile:

| Project | Description | Key Technologies |
|---|---|---|
| **chat_module_server / chat_module_client** | Real-time chat / messaging platform (server & client) | Node.js, WebSocket, React |
| **eventdashboard** | Dashboard & event management system | Next.js, REST APIs |
| **file-organizer** | A utility for organizing & categorizing files automatically | Python scripting |
| **x-clipboard-manager** | Lightweight tool to manage and persist clipboard history | C++ |

*(Each of these repos demonstrates my ability to build end-to-end features, integrate modules, and ship working software.)*

## What I Bring to the Table

- **Launch & Cutover Expertise** — More than managing, I dive into QA, patching, and problem-solving during critical windows.  
- **Team Leadership & Mentorship** — I guide junior devs, perform code reviews, unblock issues, and keep momentum high.  
- **Product-Minded Engineering** — I think in flows, user journeys, edge cases, and “what happens if X fails” before it breaks in production.  
- **AI & Logic Systems** — I bridge creative logic (e.g. tarot engines, horoscope flows) with clean architecture and robust data pipelines.  
- **Strong Cross-Zone Communication** — I’m used to overlapping with US, EU, and IST teams, syncing in Slack, delivering status, and keeping all stakeholders aligned.

## What I’m Looking For

I enjoy contracts or full-time roles where:

- I can **own core product systems** (migrations, new modules, architecture changes)  
- The team values **technical rigor, launch discipline, and operational excellence**  
- I get to build **AI/ML-enhanced features or SaaS modules**  
- There’s room to **mentor, lead, and grow**
